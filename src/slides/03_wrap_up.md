## Options

> this was a simple demo, more advanced ways of working

 - upload of data triggers script
 - download script at run time
 - use AWS database services for data storage/retrieval
 - Batch does have dependencies- chain steps together

---

## Strengths of Batch

 - Simplifies scaling up analyses
 - Great for bulk computation (when *quantity* matters)

---

## Limitations of Batch

 - Not ideal for rapidly iterating workflow
   - Many changes can require rebuilding the
     container image
 - Data access can be a challenge
 

---

## Next Steps

  - We can work with you to develop a pipeline using Batch
  - Our goal is to move load off of gizmo- current and future
